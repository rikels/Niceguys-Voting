Hi,
This is the repository of Niceguys Voting, It's a little tool to help you make polls that can be directly answered in the chat by your viewers.<br />
*If something doesn't work, drop me a message.

<h1>Download</h1>
You can download a pre-build file from: http://rikels.info/share/Niceguys_Voting.zip
Take a look at the config file, you can change some things if you want?

<h2>Info</h2>
You can use timed voting with the key combo: "Windows key+ F3", and you can add time with: "Windows key + F4".<br />
With the key combo: "Windows key + F2" it will reset the current votes, so the counters will reset to 0. <br />
Users sometimes think it's !vote1 (without space), I built this to accept it with spaces, without spaces, with tabs and things like: !\/073 are also accepted.<br />
There are a few settings which can be changed to suit your needs, check the config.txt file in the folder for all options.
